		<h1> The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air </h1>
		<p> From western Philadelphia I hail
			where in my youth I'd play upon the green
			'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
			by ruffians contemptible and mean.
			Although the spat was trivial and brief, 
			it wounded my dear mother deep within;
			and so, to give her conscience sweet relief, 
			she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
			When to my port of call I'd been conveyed, 
			I came upon a coachman most unique;
			and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
			despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
			I survey all the land with princely mien
			in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene. </p>
